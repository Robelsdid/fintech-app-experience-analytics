## Ethics Considerations

2. **Sample Bias**: Analysis focused on Google Play Store users only, may not represent all customer segments

4. **Temporal Bias**: Reviews collected at a specific time may not reflect current app performance after recent updates

### Mitigation Strategies
- Acknowledge limitations in the analysis scope
- Recommend additional data collection from other sources
- Suggest multilingual review analysis for future studies
- Emphasize the need for continuous monitoring rather than one-time analysis
